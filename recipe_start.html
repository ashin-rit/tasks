    <h1> Quick hummus recipe </h1>
    <img src="images/hummus.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>1 can of chickpeas (garbanzo beans)</li>
      <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
      <li>1 red pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of tahini (sesame seed paste)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Drain the chickpeas and rinse them under cold water.</li>
        <li>Peel and chop the garlic.</li>
        <li>Remove the seeds from the red pepper and chop it into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Place all the ingredients into a food processor or blender.</li>
        <li>Blend until smooth, adding a little water if necessary to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <h3>Storage</h3>

    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
